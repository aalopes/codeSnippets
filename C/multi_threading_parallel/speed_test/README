These are simple tests for evaluating the performance of different
multi-threading / code parallelization approaches.
The tests are very synthetic and certainly not optimal. 
In any case the objective is to have no race conditions or any ``dangerous''
events, and to provide the results of all calculations to the parent / main
thread.

Also since the code is different between examples, it might not be comparable.
