Note that running the same code twice, results in the second code block running
faster than the first one (probably due to caching), therefore I split the
sequencial and parallel codes.

And here are the results on an Intel i5, xxx with 4 cores:

-- OPEN MP --
Total wall-time: 0.575594 s
Total cpu-time:  2.155 s

-- Sequential --
Total wall-time: 1.58989 s
Total cpu-time:  1.59034 s

So OPEN MP does take more CPU time, but since it's spread across the 4 cores,
it takes around 1/3 of the time of the sequential program.
Also, since the sequential program only uses one core, the wall-time and
the cpu-time are identical.
