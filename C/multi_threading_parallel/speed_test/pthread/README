A small experiment comparing two scenarios:
 1) main thread performs a calculation loops as well (N_THREADS = 3)
 2) main thread just waits for threads to join -
    an extra thread is created to do the job (N_THREADS = 4)

with N_LOOP =  100000000

on a 4-core CPU increased run-time from 6.1378 s to 8.08844 s .
