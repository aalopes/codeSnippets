# codeSnippets 
Some small, sometimes trivial, code snippets

These are some code snippets I have either created myself
or collected from the internet and slightly changed.

I am always afraid of forgetting some stuff, therefore I find
it better to put it somewhere. If I needed it later, I know
where to find it.

These are organized either by language or by topic (in which case,
there are examples for more than one language).
