Note that Matlab is always much slower on the first run.

=======================================
CPU (results in s):

First run:
Elapsed wall time (IO)    0
Elapsed wall time (Conv)  8.396990e-01
Elapsed wall time (Canny) 2.041845e+00

Second run:
Elapsed wall time (IO)    0
Elapsed wall time (Conv)  5.738000e-03
Elapsed wall time (Canny) 1.184340e-01

Note: for some reason the IO timing is not working
(but did work on Windows with Matlab 2016a).
